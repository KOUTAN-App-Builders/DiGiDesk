[Message from the Creator]
Thank you for checking out my project.
I’m a beginner and learning how to code with Swift.
If you are a Pro or an experienced person, I will be happy if you can tell me how to resolve the issues mentioned above. If possible, please give me a message in the “issue” section.
Although I made this code referencing the videos & sites, I will be happy if you would use the code mentioning my name (KOUTAN-App-Builders) and not use it commercially.
Also, I’m a Japanese student and may have problems with my English.
If possible, I am planning to create a localized READ ME file (probably Japanese). 
Stay tuned for version 1.0 and future versions, features to come.
Again, thanks for visiting, and I hope everyone will have a wonderful developer experience.

Big Thanks,
KOUTAN-App-Builders
